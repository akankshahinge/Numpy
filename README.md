# Numpy - Numerical Python
1. The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
2. Powerful N-dimensional arrays: Fast and versatile, the NumPy vectorization, indexing, and broadcasting concepts are the de-facto standards of array computing today.
3. Numerical computing tools: NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines
4. Open source
5. At the core of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types
6. NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically). Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original
7. The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will be the same size in memory.
8. Numpy uses the best of both world - C and Python. C has efficient looping method to loop for millions of data and it uses python feature of broadcasting and vectorization.
9. Numpy is faster becauses it uses vectorization. Vectorization is absence of looping and indexing explicitly but its uses just behind the scence, it uses this but in optimized pre-complied C code.
10. In Numpy impliciptly, broadcasting is used. In broadcasting element by element operations are performed.
11. In NumPy dimensions are called axes.
12. NumPyâ€™s array class is called ndarray.
13. numpy.array is not the same as the Standard Python Library class array.array, which only handles one-dimensional arrays and offers less functionality.
